The Southern region made the most revenue with four million, six hundred and seventy five thousand dollars ($4,675,000) selling three (3) products viz socks, shoes and gloves, this accounted for 44.16% of the total revenue, while the Western region made the least revenue, one million, five hundred and twelve thousand, five hundred dollars ($1,512,500) despite selling four (4) products viz socks, shoes, hat and gloves.


#### Inference
- The West needs to be checked for why its not making huge sales
- What is happening in the South that is making it record huge sales should be introduced in the West and other regions if possible
- Hat can remain on the product list, since there will always be a product that will do well or not do well, in any case, the well performing product and the not so well performing product will always complement each other
