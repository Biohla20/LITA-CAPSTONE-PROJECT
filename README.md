#### Inference
- There should be an investigation as to why the West is not making huge sales (revenue).
- The tchnique employed in the South which helps the region to generate huge revenue should be introduce in the West and other regions if possible, so that all regions can make huge profits.
- Hat can remain on the product list, since there will always be a product that will do well or not do well, in any case, the well performing product and the not so well performing product will complement each other.


#### Additional Documentation
