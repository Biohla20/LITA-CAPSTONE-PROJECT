###### Inference
- The West needs to be checked for why its not making huge sales
- What is happening in the South that is making it record huge sales should be introduced in the West and other regions if possible
- Hat can remain on the product list, since there will always be a product that will do well or not do well, in any case, the well performing product and the not so well performing product will always complement each other
